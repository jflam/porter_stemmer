# porter stemming algorithm

Implementation of the Porter Stemming Algorithm based on the paper by 
Porter in 1980: https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/def.txt

It uses two test files from the web page maintained by Martin Porter:
https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/. These files are called
words.txt and expected.txt and are stored in the data directory.

The test_stemmer.py file will run a test to validate that the expected
words are generated from the input words.
